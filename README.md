# MITxPRO-BadBankReact

A pure REACT App to simulate a Bad Bank with no security features.


## Description

This will be used for my MIT xPRO Portfolio.
This Bad Bank project is a refactored version of the Bad Bank 'Fire Hydrant' project I did<br />
in the previous MIT 'Digital Transformation' course in December 2021.
It was bascially rewritten from scratch in React Components, Context, and State.
